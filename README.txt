Customer cross item promotion predictor:
 The client requested a software solution to obtain customer emails from a database
 who have not purchased an item but would have a high probability of purchasing
 it in the future leading to a targeted promotion.
 The search/query could not take longer than 3 seconds on a Web Application over a 20Mbps WLAN.
 The initial data mining procedures along with a GitHub link
 to the code can be viewed @ https://richsoftdev.pythonanywhere.com/ccipp

The Data supplied is not the clients Data but a generic test file similar to the clients dataset. 
The data set contains approx 250000 rows and 8 columns.
parent.py is a console run application which was used initialy to analyse the data before designing the WebApp
